This is the fork of [hanko.io](https://hanko.io) of the [duo-labs](https://github.com/duo-labs/webauthn) webauthn library .
We modified it to suit our needs and added some missing features:

* Support for Resident Keys
* Possibility to add a Policy which decides on which Authenticators are accepted when an Attestation is sent
* Apple Attestation support

# Usage
